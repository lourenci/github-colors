# üêô Yet another GitHub colorscheme

I've tried a lot of themes trying to reproduce the GitHub one, but all of them fall trying to reproduce them. This is my attempt.

## Why this one is different?

GitHub uses tree-sitter to parse the source code and to colorize them. This is the reason why it's so hard to reproduce its colors. With `nvim 0.5` we can do the same thing, theoretically.

## Features

- Light color
- Dim (soft dark) color
- tree-sitter syntax

## Setup

How we need to leverage tree-sitter, we can't support `vim` or `nvim 0.4`, though you can try it. I don't have any plans to try to port it for the mentioned ones.

```viml

" for vim 0.5.x
Plug 'nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter', {'do': ':TSUpdate', 'branch': '0.5-compat' }
Plug 'lourenci/github-colors', { 'branch': 'main' }

"
" if you are using vim-plug, make sure below config is after
" "call plug#end()" - https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter/issues/914
"

lua <<EOF
require'nvim-treesitter.configs'.setup {
  highlight = {
    enable = true,
  }
}
EOF

set background=dark
" or set background=light
colorscheme github-colors
```
