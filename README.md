# Yet another GitHub colorscheme

I've tried a lot of themes trying to reproduce the GitHub one, but all of them fall trying to reproduce them. This is my attempt.

## Why this one is different?

GitHub uses tree-sitter to parse the source code and to colorize them. This is the reason why it's so hard to reproduce its colors. With `nvim 0.5` we can do the same thing, theoretically.

## Setup

How we need to leverage tree-sitter, we can't support `vim` or `nvim 0.4`.

ðŸš§ This is in an early stage. It's expected to have breaking changes. ðŸš§

```
Plug 'nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter', {'do': ':TSUpdate'}
lua <<EOF
require'nvim-treesitter.configs'.setup {
  highlight = {
    enable = true,
  }
}
EOF
Plug 'lourenci/github-colors'

set background=dark
colorscheme github-colors
```

## Roadmap

- [ ] Dim color (soft dark)
  - [x] ruby
  - [x] TypeScript
  - [x] JSON
  - [x] yaml (partial, yaml tree-sitter does not parse some fields yet)
  - [x] JavaScript
  - [x] Diff color
- [ ] Light color
  - [x] ruby
  - [x] TypeScript
  - [x] JSON
  - [x] yaml (partial, yaml tree-sitter does not parse some fields yet)
  - [x] Diff color
- [ ] Black dark?
